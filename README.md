ALY_6000 FINAL PROJECT DATA ANALYSIS
Banking Dataset Marketing Targets
Module 6 Project ALY6000 Introduction to Analytics [CRN 22279]

For my final project ALY6000, I worked on Banking Dataset: Marketing Targets. Banking Dataset of several customers to predict if they will convert their money to bank term deposit or not. I was searching for datasets and came across Kaggle datasets. As I have started analyzing the dataset I faced many challenges which will be explained in the below post.

A bank's term deposits are a significant source of revenue. A fixed deposit is a short-term monetary investment held at a bank. Your funds invested for a set rate of return over a set length of time. The bank uses a variety of outreach strategies to sell term deposits to their customers, including email, telephonic ,advertisements, and digital marketing.
